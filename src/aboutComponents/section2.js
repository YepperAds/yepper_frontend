                    Yes! Ol Express will not use its own vehicles to deliver packages. Instead, people who have trucks, vehicles (cars, mini-buses), bikes (normal bicycles, those bikes which are already made to deliver packages) will work with us. We will have these vehicles for a contracted period, and we will compensate the owners based on the number of packages delivered, similar to a carpooling system. During the contracted period, the vehicles will be branded as ours.
